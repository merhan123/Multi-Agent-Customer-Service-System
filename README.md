# Enterprise Multi-Agent Architecture with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

**Udacity - School of AI | Course 3.3 | Capstone Project 3.3 NovaMart**

A production-grade multi-agent customer support system built with the [Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. The system automatically routes customer support requests to specialist agents, retrieves grounded knowledge via **parallel multi-agent RAG**, enforces enterprise safety guardrails, and maintains shared workflow state across agents - all observable through CloudWatch and X-Ray.

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Model | Responsibility | Tools |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **OrchestratorAgent** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Routes requests, creates/updates WorkflowState | `initialize_session`, `route_to_inventory_agent`, `route_to_policy_agent`, `route_to_refund_agent`, `route_to_communication_agent` |
| **InventoryAgent** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Gathers order and customer facts from DynamoDB | `check_order_status`, `get_customer_tier`, `list_customer_orders` |
| **PolicyAgent** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Coordinates parallel RAG retrieval from 3 KBs, synthesizes results | `search_all_policies` (internally fans out to 3 retriever sub-agents) |
| **RefundAgent** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Makes return/refund eligibility decisions (30-day Standard, 60-day Premium) | `get_inventory_context`, `initiate_refund` |
| **CommunicationAgent** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Drafts final, empathetic customer-facing response | `get_full_workflow_context` |

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent RAG**: PolicyAgent runs 3 specialized retriever sub-agents in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor, merges results, and deduplicates by relevance
- **Shared Workflow State**: DynamoDB `WorkflowStateTable` with optimistic locking (version-based conditional writes) ensures consistency across concurrent agent updates
- **Enterprise Guardrails**: Bedrock Guardrails block harmful content, PII, and off-topic conversations
- **Observability**: Every request is traced to AWS X-Ray (Orchestrator → Worker → Knowledge Base call chain) and logged to CloudWatch Logs - locally and from the deployed runtime
- **Bedrock Knowledge Bases**: Uses an S3 Vectors backing store (vector bucket + one index per KB, created by the stack) for policy retrieval (no custom embeddings)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (matches the deployed runtime)
- AWS account with Bedrock access enabled (`us-east-1` region)
- IAM permissions for: Bedrock, Bedrock AgentCore, DynamoDB, S3, S3 Vectors, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, X-Ray (the AgentCore CLI deploys through AWS CDK, so `cloudformation:*`, `iam:PassRole` and the CDK bootstrap roles are needed too)
- Bedrock Knowledge Bases created manually in AWS Console (Task 5)
- **AgentCore CLI** (`agentcore`, npm package [`@aws/agentcore`](https://github.com/aws/agentcore-cli)) - the deploy command uses it to package and deploy the runtime (Task 3). It needs **Node.js 20+** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

  ```bash
  npm install -g @aws/agentcore@0.30.0
  agentcore --version
  ```

  > The CLI replaces the older Python `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit`. Both install an `agentcore` command, so uninstall the old one if you have it: `pip uninstall bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit`.
- The AgentCore Runtime runs on arm64 and Python 3.12; `agentcore deploy` downloads matching wheels for you with `uv` (needs internet access)

---

## Setup

This is the unfinished student starter: complete the TODOs in `src/agent_orchestrator.py`. The CLI configuration and support modules are provided infrastructure, not exercise solutions. Runtime deployment and runtime configuration updates use AgentCore CLI; application service calls still use the AWS SDK.

Use the tested CLI version **0.30.0** shown above. The supplied CDK compatibility fix keeps HTTP explicit in the deployed runtime metadata.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy .env template
cp .env.example .env

# Verify AWS resources
python config.py
```

Expected output: Configuration table showing all resource names. Fields showing `(not yet created)` are expected - they are populated as each task is completed.

### 3. Verify the AgentCore CLI

```bash
agentcore --version      # 0.30.0 or newer
agentcore validate       # checks agentcore/agentcore.json (the runtime definition)
```

### 4. Seed Initial Data

Run once after the CloudFormation stack reaches `CREATE_COMPLETE`:

```bash
python infrastructure/seed_data.py
```

This populates:
- DynamoDB tables with four mock customers (`CUST-001` … `CUST-004`) and their orders. The data is deterministic - the order IDs used by `demo.py`, `test` mode and the `chat` welcome table (e.g. `ORD-27176`) always exist
- S3 `policy-docs` bucket with sample policy documents under `policies/returns/`, `policies/shipping/`, `policies/warranty/`

## Tasks & Implementation

### Task 2 - Multi-Agent Graph
**File:** `src/agent_orchestrator.py`
**Time:** ~90 minutes

Implement 5 Strands Agents in an Orchestrator → Workers hierarchy:

#### **2.A - InventoryAgent**
Gathers order and customer facts from DynamoDB (no decisions).
- **Tools:** `check_order_status`, `get_customer_tier`, `list_customer_orders`
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`config.WORKER_MODEL_ID`) | **Temperature:** 0.1
- The Orders table has a composite key (`customer_id` + `order_id`), so `check_order_status` takes both - the stub already has the right signature

#### **2.B - RefundAgent**
Makes return/refund eligibility decisions based on customer tier and dates.
- **Tools:** `get_inventory_context`, `initiate_refund`
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`config.WORKER_MODEL_ID`) | **Temperature:** 0.1

#### **2.C - PolicyAgent** ⭐
**Multi-Agent RAG Coordinator:** Runs 3 retriever sub-agents in parallel.
```
PolicyAgent
    ├─ ReturnsPolicyRetriever  → config.RETURNS_KB_ID
    ├─ ShippingPolicyRetriever → config.SHIPPING_KB_ID
    └─ WarrantyPolicyRetriever → config.WARRANTY_KB_ID
```
- **Tool:** `search_all_policies` - fans out to all 3 retrievers via ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Output:** Merged, deduplicated results ranked by relevance
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`config.WORKER_MODEL_ID`) | **Temperature:** 0.2

#### **2.D - CommunicationAgent**
Composes final customer-facing response from accumulated WorkflowState.
- **Tools:** `get_full_workflow_context`
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`config.WORKER_MODEL_ID`) | **Temperature:** 0.3

#### **2.E - OrchestratorAgent**
Routes requests and manages shared WorkflowState.

- **Tools:** `initialize_session`, `route_to_inventory_agent`, `route_to_policy_agent`, `route_to_refund_agent`, `route_to_communication_agent`
- **Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (`config.ORCHESTRATOR_MODEL_ID` - fast, cost-efficient) | **Temperature:** 0.0 (deterministic)

The orchestrator system prompt must enforce these routing rules exactly:

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Every request, always | Call `initialize_session` first |
| 2 | Order status / return / refund requests | Call `route_to_inventory_agent` → then `route_to_refund_agent` |
| 3 | Policy meaning questions (windows, rates, terms) | Call `route_to_policy_agent` |
| 4 | Account questions ("what is my tier?", "am I premium?") | Call `route_to_inventory_agent` - **never** `route_to_policy_agent` (it only knows policy text, not customer data) |
| 5 | Math / calculation questions | Calculate without Inventory, Policy or Refund; call CommunicationAgent last |
| 6 | Every request, always (last step) | Call `route_to_communication_agent` to compose the final reply |

> **CRITICAL:** The Orchestrator is **never** permitted to write the final customer-facing response itself. It must always delegate to `route_to_communication_agent` as its very last action - no exceptions, even when it believes it already has a complete answer.

**Test:**
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task2
```

---

### Task 3 - AgentCore Runtime & Guardrails
**File:** `src/agent_orchestrator.py`

- **`create_guardrail()`** - Create Bedrock Guardrail with:
  - Content filtering: SEXUAL, VIOLENCE, HATE (HIGH strength) + INSULTS, MISCONDUCT (MEDIUM strength)
  - PII redaction (emails, phones anonymized; credit cards and SSNs blocked)
  - Topic blocking (competitor products, pricing negotiations, legal threats)
  - Use `topicPolicyConfig.tierConfig = {"tierName": "STANDARD"}` and top-level `crossRegionConfig = {"guardrailProfileIdentifier": "us.guardrail.v1:0"}`. Define pricing negotiations narrowly as haggling or changing an advertised price; permit arithmetic with an already-specified price and discount. Classic-tier definitions tested in this project blocked the required math scenario. Validate arithmetic inputs/outputs and blocked negotiation, competitor and legal-threat examples. See [AWS safeguard tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-tiers.html).
  - Profanity filtering
  - Then `create_guardrail_version()` so the returned version is a number, not `DRAFT`

- **`deploy_to_agentcore_runtime()`** - Deploy the system to AgentCore Runtime with the guardrail attached, using the **AgentCore CLI** (`agentcore`, wrapped by the pre-written `src/agentcore_cli.py`)
  - The pre-written part stages your `agent_orchestrator.py` (which doubles as the HTTP entry point - `serve` mode) with its helper modules and `config.py` in `build/runtime/` - the directory `agentcore/agentcore.json` points at (`codeLocation`)
  - Your part:
    1. build the runtime environment variables dict (region, project name, KB IDs, log group, `GUARDRAIL_ID`, `GUARDRAIL_VERSION`)
    2. `agentcore_cli.configure_runtime(env_vars=..., network_mode='PUBLIC', protocol='HTTP', execution_role_arn=config.AGENTCORE_ROLE_ARN)` - writes those settings into `agentcore/agentcore.json`
    3. `agentcore_cli.deploy()` - runs `agentcore deploy -y`: the CLI packages `build/runtime/` with arm64 dependencies (*direct code deployment*, `build: CodeZip`) and creates or updates the runtime through a CDK stack (`AgentCore-udacity-default`)
    4. `agentcore_cli.deployed_runtime_arn()` - the ARN the CLI recorded in `agentcore/.cli/deployed-state.json`
  - **How the guardrail is attached:** the runtime has no guardrail parameter. Guardrails are enforced per model call, so the pre-written `_apply_guardrail()` sets `guardrail_id` / `guardrail_version` on every agent's `BedrockModel` whenever `GUARDRAIL_ID` and `GUARDRAIL_VERSION` are known - from `.env` locally, from the runtime environment variables you declare when deployed

**Deployment order:** Implement Tasks 2–6 and create/sync the three S3 Vectors Knowledge Bases in Task 5 before running the full deployment. Set all three KB IDs in `.env`. The command below also calls the Task 4 Memory and Task 6 Observability functions, so those implementations must be ready. Task 3's runtime check requires the KB IDs even though Task 5 appears later in this guide.

**Deploy & Test (after those prerequisites):**
```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy
```

The first deployment also bootstraps AWS CDK in your account (a `CDKToolkit` stack) and installs the CDK app's npm packages - allow 5-10 minutes. Re-running the command is safe: an unchanged runtime is left alone, a changed one is updated in place.

The deploy command prints the Runtime ARN and Guardrail ID/Version on completion (`agentcore status` shows the same runtime). Copy those values into your `.env` file:

```
AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN=<printed arn>
GUARDRAIL_ID=<printed id>
GUARDRAIL_VERSION=<printed version>
```

Then run the tests:
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task3
```

---

### Task 4 - Memory
**File:** `src/agent_orchestrator.py`

- **`configure_memory(runtime_arn)`** - Create an AgentCore Memory resource with `agentcore_control.create_memory()`:
  - Strategy: SESSION_SUMMARY (`summaryMemoryStrategy`)
  - Storage: `eventExpiryDuration=7` days
  - Maintains conversation context across turns so customers don't repeat themselves between turns
  - The pre-written part waits until the resource is `ACTIVE`; the test finds it by name (`config.MEMORY_NAME`)

**Test:**
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task4
```

---

### Task 5 - Bedrock Knowledge Bases (Not in starter - done in AWS Console)

Create 3 Knowledge Bases in the AWS Console. The S3 data bucket and the S3 Vectors bucket are the same for all three - only the prefix and the vector index differ. Run `python config.py` to print the exact bucket and index names for your account (they carry a stack-specific suffix):

| Setting | Returns KB | Shipping KB | Warranty KB |
|---|---|---|---|
| S3 data bucket | *Policy Bucket* from `python config.py` | same | same |
| S3 prefix | `policies/returns/` | `policies/shipping/` | `policies/warranty/` |
| Embedding model | `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` | same | same |
| Vector store | S3 Vectors → *Use an existing vector bucket* | same | same |
| Vector bucket | *Vector Bucket* from `python config.py` | same | same |
| Vector index | `returns-policy-index` | `shipping-policy-index` | `warranty-policy-index` |

Choose a self-managed Knowledge Base with the existing S3 Vectors store, not a Managed Knowledge Base. The vector bucket and the three indexes are created by the CloudFormation stack (dimension 1024, cosine, `AMAZON_BEDROCK_TEXT` non-filterable), so pick them in the wizard - do **not** use *Quick create a new vector store*. After creating each KB, click **Sync** on its data source.

After creating all three KBs, add their IDs to `.env`:
```
RETURNS_KB_ID=
SHIPPING_KB_ID=
WARRANTY_KB_ID=
```

Complete Task 6 before the first full deployment. If you deployed earlier, run `python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy` again after setting these IDs; editing local `.env` alone does not update the deployed runtime. Then rerun `python tests/test_agent.py task3` and the Task 5 test below.

**Test:**
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task5
```

---

### Task 6 - Observability
**File:** `src/agent_orchestrator.py`

- **`configure_observability(runtime_arn)`** - Enable logging and tracing by building a `loggingConfiguration` and handing it to the pre-written `apply_observability_config()` (wrapped in `try/except`):
  - **CloudWatch:** `cloudWatchConfig` - INFO-level logs to `config.AGENT_LOG_GROUP` (`/aws/bedrock/agentcore/udacity-agentcore`), `enabled=True`
  - **X-Ray:** `xRayConfig` - `enabled=True`, `samplingRate=1.0` (100% in dev, reduce to 5% in prod)
  - `apply_observability_config()` turns that into real AWS state: it enables CloudWatch **Transaction Search** (the mechanism AgentCore Observability uses) at the given sampling percentage, creates the log group, and stores the settings as environment variables on your AgentCore Runtime so the deployed agent logs and traces exactly as configured

**How traces reach X-Ray:** `agent_observability.py` (pre-written) records every request as one X-Ray trace. Each `route_to_*` tool becomes a worker-agent node and each Knowledge Base retrieval a `KnowledgeBase:*` node, published with `xray:PutTraceSegments`. This works identically from your machine (`test`, `chat`, `demo`) and inside the deployed runtime (`invoke`).

**After testing, verify end-to-end tracing:**
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task6

# Then run a live test - each scenario prints its X-Ray trace id
python src/agent_orchestrator.py test

# View the map in AWS Console → CloudWatch → X-Ray traces → Service map
# (or X-Ray → Service map). Select "Last 5 minutes"; allow 30-60 s.
```

---

### Deployment Pipeline

When you run `python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy`, it executes a 6-step pipeline:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| 1/6 | Build the 5-agent graph locally |
| 2/6 | Create the Bedrock Guardrail |
| 3/6 | Stage the code in `build/runtime/`, write the runtime settings to `agentcore/agentcore.json` and deploy with `agentcore deploy -y` (AgentCore CLI) |
| 4/6 | Create AgentCore Memory |
| 5/6 | Configure Observability (CloudWatch + X-Ray Transaction Search) - the runtime environment variables are applied with a second `agentcore deploy -y` |
| 6/6 | Deploy AgentCore Gateway *(skipped if Lambda tool functions not deployed)* |

Step 6 is an optional extension, not required for the project or its 120-point grading suite. To opt in, deploy Lambda tool functions separately and set their names in `ORDERS_FUNCTION`, `POLICY_FUNCTION`, and/or `CUSTOMERS_FUNCTION` in `.env`. The scaffolding checks configured functions before creating a gateway. If none are available, it prints a skip message and creates no gateway. Missing functions are reported; other AWS errors are reported as failures of the optional step. Agents continue to use their in-process tools; using the gateway requires a separate MCP client integration.

---

### Task 7 - End-to-End Submission Test

After completing all tasks, run the full deployment and verify these three scenarios manually:

| Scenario | Expected Routing |
|----------|-----------------|
| `"I want to return my order ORD-27176"` (CUST-001) | Orchestrator → Inventory → Refund → Communication |
| `"What is the return policy for premium customers?"` | Orchestrator → Policy (3 parallel KB retrievers) → Communication |
| `"How much are 5 items at $29.99 with 10% off?"` | Orchestrator → Communication (no Inventory, Policy or Refund) |

**Required deliverable:**
- Take a screenshot that shows that all test passed, and shows that you have 120 scores (`python tests/test_agent.py all`).
- Take a screenshot of your **X-Ray Service Map** after running a live request (`python src/agent_orchestrator.py test`). Navigate to **AWS Console → CloudWatch → X-Ray traces → Service map** (also reachable as X-Ray → Service map) and capture the full trace graph showing the `NovaMart-Orchestrator` → Worker (→ Knowledge Base) call chain.

---

### Task 8 - Clean Up

Once you have your screenshots and have submitted the project, remove everything the project created so it stops costing money:

```bash
python infrastructure/cleanup.py          # dry run - lists what would be deleted
python infrastructure/cleanup.py --yes    # deletes it
```

The script deletes, in dependency order: the three Knowledge Bases (with their data sources and the service roles the console created for them), the AgentCore CLI stack that holds the AgentCore Runtime (`AgentCore-udacity-default`) and the Memory, the Guardrail, the contents of the policy bucket, the CloudFormation stack (DynamoDB tables, buckets, S3 Vectors bucket and indexes, execution role, log group) and the runtime log groups. Deletions of Knowledge Bases and AgentCore resources are asynchronous - run it a second time to confirm nothing is left. Add `--disable-transaction-search` if you also want to switch CloudWatch Transaction Search back off.

> Do this **after** submitting: the reviewer needs your screenshots, but nothing in the reviewed submission depends on the resources still existing.

---

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run individual task tests:
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task2   # Multi-agent orchestration
python tests/test_agent.py task3   # AgentCore deployment
python tests/test_agent.py task4   # Memory
python tests/test_agent.py task5   # Knowledge base retrieval
python tests/test_agent.py task6   # Observability
```

Run full suite:
```bash
python tests/test_agent.py all
```

Expected output:
- Color-coded test results (✓ pass, ✗ fail)
- Summary at the end

### Live Testing

Run 3 hardcoded end-to-end scenarios against your local agent:
```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py test
```

Launch an interactive terminal session with step-by-step trace output:
```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py chat
```

Send one message to the **deployed** AgentCore Runtime (after Task 3):
```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py invoke "What is the return policy for premium customers?" CUST-002

# or with the AgentCore CLI (customer defaults to CUST-001; pass JSON to choose one)
agentcore invoke "What is the return policy for premium customers?"
agentcore invoke '{"prompt": "I want to return my order ORD-27176", "customer_id": "CUST-001"}'
agentcore status        # deployed runtime details
agentcore logs          # runtime logs
```

The `chat` command opens a conversation loop where you type queries and watch the orchestrator route them in real time - colour-coded by agent (Inventory, Policy, Refund, Communication). It uses a pre-written terminal UI (`AgentTrace` / `_TraceWriter`) built into `agent_orchestrator.py`. **This scaffolding is pre-implemented and requires no modification.**

---

## Infrastructure

The foundation infrastructure is defined in `infrastructure/starter_stack.yaml` and provisions DynamoDB tables, the S3 policy-documents bucket, an S3 Vectors bucket with three vector indexes, the AgentCore execution role, and the CloudWatch log group.

> Deploy it once (stack name `udacity-agentcore`, region `us-east-1`, with `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`) before starting, as described in the project's *Environment Setup* page, then run `python infrastructure/seed_data.py`. The AI layer is built on top via code; the stack itself is never modified.

---

## Deployment

Full end-to-end deployment:
```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy
```

This:
1. Builds all 5 agents
2. Creates guardrail
3. Deploys to AgentCore Runtime with the AgentCore CLI (`agentcore deploy -y`, definition in `agentcore/agentcore.json`)
4. Configures memory
5. Enables observability

---

## Key Concepts

### Strands Agents
```python
from strands import Agent, tool           # in this project `tool` is imported from
from strands.models import BedrockModel   # agent_observability (same decorator + X-Ray tracing)

@tool
def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Agent reads this docstring to understand when to use the tool."""
    return f"Result: {param}"

model = BedrockModel(model_id="...", region_name="us-east-1", temperature=0.1)
agent = Agent(model=model, system_prompt="You are...", tools=[my_tool])
response = agent("Hello!")  # Call agent like a function
```

### WorkflowState Pattern
```python
# Create at session start
state = _create_workflow_state(session_id)

# Read in tools
current_state = _read_workflow_state(session_id)

# Update with optimistic locking
updated_state = _update_workflow_state(
    session_id,
    updates={'inventory_agent': agent_response},
    expected_version=current_state['version']
)
```

### Parallel Execution (Multi-Agent RAG)
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    futures = {
        executor.submit(returns_retriever, query): 'returns',
        executor.submit(shipping_retriever, query): 'shipping',
        executor.submit(warranty_retriever, query): 'warranty',
    }
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        policy_type = futures[future]
        results[policy_type] = future.result()
```

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file holds values that are populated progressively as each task is completed:

```bash
# AWS Settings
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
PROJECT_NAME=udacity-agentcore

# Most AWS resource names/ARNs (DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, IAM role, log group)
# are loaded automatically from CloudFormation exports - no entries needed here.

# Bedrock Knowledge Base IDs (Task 5) - create manually in AWS Console
RETURNS_KB_ID=
SHIPPING_KB_ID=
WARRANTY_KB_ID=

# AgentCore Runtime (Task 3) - printed by: python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy
# (created with the AgentCore CLI from agentcore/agentcore.json; `agentcore status` shows it too)
AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN=

# Guardrail (Task 3) - populated by the deploy command above (a numbered version, not DRAFT)
GUARDRAIL_ID=
GUARDRAIL_VERSION=
```

## Troubleshooting

**Config loading errors?**
```bash
python config.py
```
`config.py` resolves values differently depending on the variable type - always run `python config.py` first to see exactly what is and isn't loaded.

| Variable | Where it comes from | What to do if missing |
|---|---|---|
| DynamoDB tables, S3 + S3 Vectors buckets, IAM role, log group | CloudFormation exports only - no `.env` fallback | Verify stack `udacity-agentcore` is `CREATE_COMPLETE` in `us-east-1` (redeploy the stack if it predates the S3 Vectors resources) |
| `RETURNS_KB_ID`, `SHIPPING_KB_ID`, `WARRANTY_KB_ID` | `.env` file (student path) | Complete Task 5 - create KBs in AWS Console, then paste IDs into `.env` |
| `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN` | `.env` file only | Complete Task 3 - run `python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy`, then paste the output ARN into `.env` |
| `GUARDRAIL_ID`, `GUARDRAIL_VERSION` | `.env` file (student path) | Complete Task 3 - the deploy command prints these values; paste them into `.env` |

> **Note:** KB ID fields showing `(not yet created)` in `config.py` output is **expected** before Task 5 is completed. This is not an error - it indicates Knowledge Bases have not yet been created.

**Agent tool errors?**
Check agent system prompts and tool docstrings - agents read docstrings to understand tools.

**WorkflowState conflicts?**
Review `_update_workflow_state()` logic - optimistic locking retries on version conflicts.

**X-Ray traces not appearing?**
Each `test`/`chat`/`demo` run prints `X-Ray trace <id> published`. If it says *not published*, the warning above it names the cause (usually missing `xray:PutTraceSegments` permission or `AGENT_TRACING_ENABLED=false` in `.env`). In the console select a short time range ("Last 5 minutes") and allow up to 60 seconds.

**`check_order_status` fails with "The provided key element does not match the schema"?**
The Orders table key is `customer_id` + `order_id` - pass both to `get_item`.

**`agentcore: command not found` / "The AgentCore CLI is not installed"?**
Install Node.js 20+ and run `npm install -g @aws/agentcore@0.30.0` (see Prerequisites). If `agentcore` exists but prints toolkit-style help (`agentcore configure`, `agentcore launch`), that is the old Python starter toolkit - remove it with `pip uninstall bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` so the npm CLI is the one on your PATH.

**`agentcore deploy` fails while packaging (uv / wheels)?**
The CLI runs `uv pip install --python-version 3.12 --python-platform aarch64-manylinux2014 --only-binary :all:` against `build/runtime/pyproject.toml`. It needs [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your PATH and internet access. Run `python src/agentcore_cli.py` to check what the wrapper sees, and read `agentcore/.cli/logs/` for the CLI's own log.

**`agentcore deploy` fails with a CDK / CloudFormation error?**
The first deploy bootstraps CDK (`CDKToolkit` stack) - make sure your credentials may create CloudFormation stacks and IAM roles. Check the stack `AgentCore-udacity-default` in **AWS Console → CloudFormation** for the failing resource, fix the cause and re-run `python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy` (or `agentcore deploy -y`). `agentcore status` shows what is deployed.
